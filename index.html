        Good morning, good afternoon, and goodnight Mrs. Avila, We have made this to inform you on your teaching skills that have greatly helped me. All of your lessons have helped us and other students to pass classes and further increase our knowledge of not only geometry but algebra aswell. You have been the best math teacher that we have come upon in our school curriculum because of this. Not only are u a good teacher but a chill and cool one aswell. We like the environment you have set us with and we enjoy going to your classroom. We always think of entering this wonderful place the moment we enter school, once we get to your class, we are happily ready to learn and face any challenge that you face us with. We also appreciate the vibe you bring in your classroom and the rules that you enforce upon us to make us greater in every way possible. You made us intuitively interested in geometry and is in our daily discussions because of you. We have implicated out knowledge about geometry and some algebra into our real life situations on a monthly basis. Oh and by the way we finished our ixl for you.
